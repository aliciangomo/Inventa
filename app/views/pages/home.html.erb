      <br>
      <p class="main-text"> <span id="love">LOVE</span> ‚ô•Ô∏è... Emotions are the start of each of my paintings. Love in particular, which I believe is the most powerful feeling. Or the pain of its loss, which is equally powerful. My creative process always starts with a strong feeling. Sometimes my own, other times an emotion conveyed by what I see and hear. Stories from other people, photos or dreams are sources of inspiration. I have awaken in the middle of the might to sketch a painting I dreamed about, or been inspired by the expression of somebody sitting in front of me in the tube.</p>
      <br>

      <p class="main-text"> <span id="music">MUSIC</span> üé∂.... Each of my paintings is linked to a song. Music is as much a part of me as each of my feelings. It is how I remember things, my "chest of memories", a soundtrack of souvenirs. Every time I work on a particular piece I use the same song to reproduce the emotional state that inspired it initially. Music creates a space where there is only the painting, the feeling and me.</p>
      <br>

      <p class="main-text"><span id="music">TRAVEL</span> üåé...Traveling is my other passion and from my travels around the üåé I gather inspiration for my paintings too. Some of my paintings are inspired by something I have seen, a sunset in some distant beach or people I met during my travels.</p>
